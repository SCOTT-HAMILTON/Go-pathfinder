# Go-pathfinder
A little go pathfinder just for fun.
It uses my go pathfind algorithms package https://github.com/SCOTT-HAMILTON/Go-pathfinderalgo

### Controls

 - You've got your current mode blinking in white on the up left corner. The two modes are
 	- ___Run mode___
 		In that mode, you can start and pause the pathfinding by clicking on the window
 	- ___Edit mode___
 		Here you can edit the map by moving the "map cursor" with the arrow keys. Once you have choose your Node, you can make it a wall with key "W", make it the start with key "S" or make it the end with...
 		key "E" .
 		
 - To switch between modes just press Tab
 
 PS : The map is saved in the map.json file each time you switch from edit mode to run mode
 		
(you may notice that pressing space bar in run mode causes to draw debug texts on top of the map)
